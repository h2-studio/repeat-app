1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:06,683
Consider a time you asked someone to drink tea, coffee, or soda.

2
00:00:07,312 --> 00:00:11,259
What kinds of terms and structures did you use?

3
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,001
In this week’s Everyday Grammar,

4
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:20,474
we will explore a point of connection between grammar and social situations.

5
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:25,997
We will talk about how to ask others if they would like a drink.

6
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:33,568
You will learn about modals as well as formal and informal kinds of questions.

7
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:38,335
Let’s start with some important terms and ideas.

8
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:46,521
Modals play a central part in everyday discussions about drinks such as coffee or tea.

9
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:51,736
Modals are short words that change the meaning of the main verb.

10
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,708
They express something about the speaker’s attitude

11
00:00:55,957 --> 00:01:00,110
whether something is permitted, necessary, possible, and so on.

12
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:03,288
In English, we have a number of modals.

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,340
But for the purposes of today’s lesson,

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,000
let’s pay careful attention to two of them: would and can.

15
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:17,910
We generally use “would” to ask a polite question or make a polite offer.

16
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:20,975
We use “can” for the same purpose,

17
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:24,202
although it is a little less formal.

18
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:26,708
Let’s take an example.

19
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:31,451
Imagine you are in your house or working in a restaurant.

20
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:36,101
You want to offer a drink to your guest or customer.

21
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:38,692
We have two ways to do that

22
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:43,722
one that involves “would” and one that involves “can.”

23
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:45,803
So, you might ask:

24
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,663
Would you like something to drink?

25
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,640
Or

26
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:53,377
Can I get you something to drink?

27
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:59,756
The main difference between our two questions is the degree of politeness.

28
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:04,315
Generally, “would” is considered more polite and formal.

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,517
Both “would” and “can” are acceptable in a number of situations.

30
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:17,226
Your house guest or customer would surely be happy to hear either of them.

31
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:22,406
Now let us consider a different kind of situation.

32
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:28,613
Maybe you are out with friends and want to ask them to get something to drink.

33
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:33,919
We can make polite offers with “would” and “can,” as in:

34
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:36,035
Would you like to get tea?

35
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:37,406
Or

36
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,487
Can I get you a coffee?

37
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,551
But we can also use the helping verb “do” to ask yes or no questions.

38
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:50,331
For example, you might ask a friend:

39
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:52,722
Do you want to get a coffee?

40
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,260
Or

41
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:56,764
Do you want to grab a drink?

42
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:01,662
Such structures are friendly but less formal.

43
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:07,795
As a result, you might not want to use them with your teacher or your
boss,

44
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:10,275
unless you are very close with them.

45
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:14,592
Now let’s take some time to work with these ideas.

46
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:21,005
Imagine you are leading a business meeting with representatives from another company.

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,168
Your visitors enter the meeting room, and you decide you want to offer them something to drink.

48
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,872
How might you make your offer?

49
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,252
Pause the audio to consider your answer.

50
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,166
There are several possible answers,

51
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:43,536
but the best two choices involve “would” or “can,” as in:

52
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,160
Would you like something drink?

53
00:03:47,122 --> 00:03:47,909
Or

54
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:50,570
Can I offer you something to drink?

55
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,047
These two sentences are polite and acceptable in official situations.

56
00:03:57,744 --> 00:04:00,384
Now consider the following sentence:

57
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:03,151
Do you want something to drink?

58
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:09,997
Why is this sentence not the best choice for an official business meeting?

59
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:15,154
The question is not very formal nor especially polite.

60
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:24,689
So, “Do you want something to drink?” is probably not the best choice to use with representatives from another company.

61
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:31,373
But, for family and good friends? That’s a question they are usually happy to hear!

62
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:38,410
Today we explored a few key ideas that connect to everyday situations

63
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,489
inviting someone to get a drink, offering a guest something to drink.

64
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:49,394
There are, of course, other ways to ask if others want something to drink.

65
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:59,678
However, the structures we explored today are among the most commonly used because they work well in most situations.

66
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:01,625
